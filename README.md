# Brain-Tumor-Radiogenomic-Classification
Predict the status of a genetic biomarker important for brain cancer treatment

This repository contains a notebook in which a model is trained to predict the status of MGMT promoter in brain MRI images. A [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification) was held on Kaggle platform by Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society (the MICCAI Society) to improve diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with glioblastoma. This model was ranked 213<sup>th</sup> on the final test samples.

## How to Run:
in order to run the notebook, it has to be uploaded on colab or kaggle. Then by clicking on `Run All` button. Make sure to upload data files in a proper directory and put `RunTime` on GPU mode!
